In this mini project, I will be attempting to utilize Typography to enchance the UX of a webpage.
The focus is to implement a visual hierarchy that attracts the user's attention to topics based
on their importance.

I will be using a lot of styling techniques ranging from color to multiple font attributes as well as
experimenting with Google Fonts.
